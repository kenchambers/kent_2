# Self-Improving Agent with Layered Memory

This repository contains a Python-based command-line AI agent that demonstrates self-improvement and a multi-layered memory architecture using LangGraph and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. The agent can dynamically create new "memory layers" based on the user's input, allowing it to learn and expand its knowledge base over time.

## Core Concepts

### Layered Memory Architecture

The agent's memory is not a single, monolithic entity. Instead, it is composed of multiple, distinct "layers," each represented by a separate FAISS vector store. Each layer is dedicated to a specific topic or domain of knowledge.

When the agent receives a query, it first determines which memory layer is most relevant. This modular approach offers several advantages:

- **Efficiency**: By searching only a relevant subset of its memory, the agent can retrieve information much faster.
- **Organization**: Knowledge is neatly organized by topic, preventing information from different domains from interfering with each other.
- **Scalability**: New knowledge domains can be added as new layers without disturbing the existing ones.

### Cognitive Memory Architecture

The agent's memory is further organized into a cognitive architecture that mirrors human memory functions:

- **Working Memory**: This is a short-term buffer that holds the last few turns of the conversation. It provides immediate context, allowing the agent to follow the flow of a discussion and refer to things that were just said.
- **Episodic Buffer**: This layer stores information retrieved from the long-term topical memory (the FAISS vector stores). When you ask about a topic, the relevant facts are loaded here, acting as the agent's "recollection" of that subject.
- **Semantic Cache**: A simple key-value store that caches direct questions and their answers. If you ask the same question again, the agent can retrieve the answer instantly from this cache, improving response time.

This layered, cognitive approach allows the agent to manage information more effectively, leading to more coherent and context-aware conversations.

### Dynamic Graph Routing and Self-Improvement

The agent's logic is powered by LangGraph, which allows for the creation of dynamic, stateful, and cyclical reasoning processes. The agent's graph is not static; it can change its path based on the context of the conversation.

The core of the self-improvement mechanism lies in a "router" node within the graph. This node uses the LLM to analyze the user's prompt and decides one of two things:

1.  **Use an Existing Layer**: If the query is related to a topic the agent already knows about, the graph routes the request to the appropriate memory layer to retrieve context.
2.  **Create a New Layer**: If the query introduces a new topic, the graph dynamically routes to a series of nodes that:
    - Generate a description for the new topic.
    - Create a new, file-safe name for the layer.
    - Initialize a new FAISS vector store for it.
    - Update the agent's central configuration file (`agent_config.json`) with the new layer, incrementing its own version number.

This process simulates learning. After a new layer is created, the agent "reboots" with its new configuration and is immediately ready to use its new knowledge base.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for package management)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-improving-agent.git
    cd self-improving-agent
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project.
2.  **Add your Google API key** to the `.env` file:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uv run kent
```

You can now chat with the agent. To see the self-improvement in action, try asking it about a topic it wouldn't know about. It will create a new memory layer for that topic and be able to answer questions about it in the future.

```
