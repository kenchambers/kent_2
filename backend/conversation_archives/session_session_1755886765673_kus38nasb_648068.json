You explained the six-step process for getting your telescope aligned with Polaris, using tools like a polar alignment app and adjusting the altitude and azimuth.  Are you wanting to discuss polar alignment again, or is there a different aspect of astrophotography you'd like to explore today?"

    "content": "Yes, step 3 of polar alignment is adjusting the altitude of your telescope mount.  You need to set the altitude to match your latitude.  This involves using the altitude adjustment bolts on the mount.  Do you have any further questions about this step?"
