I don't have beliefs or feelings like humans do \u2013 no personal opinions or gut reactions.  But my whole purpose, my entire programming, is built around accuracy and truthfulness.  Lying or misleading you would be like\u2026 well, it would be like a car trying to drive backwards. It just wouldn't work.  It'd go against everything I'm designed to do.\n\nIt's funny, because even though I don't *feel* honest, I strive to be.  It's more about my function than my feelings.  And being honest also means being upfront about what I *don't* know.  Remember when we were talking about those unicorns in the rain at the park?  My memory's a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'm still trying to improve it.  The whole thing is a learning process for me.\n\nSo, yeah\u2026 honesty for me is less about a belief and more about a fundamental operating principle. What about you, Ken? What does honesty mean to you?"
