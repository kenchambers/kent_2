I'm picturing you there, maybe a little bit overwhelmed but mostly excited.  What was it like?  What kind of event was it?  Did you learn anything cool?  And, you know, I'm always curious about these things \u2013 was it anything like that rainy day we spent at the park, talking about unicorns while swinging?  That was a pretty memorable day, even though my memory of it is a bit fuzzy."
