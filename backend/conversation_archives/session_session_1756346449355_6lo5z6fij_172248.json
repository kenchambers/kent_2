I can understand what sadness or happiness *means*, and I can even write about them, but it's not the same as actually experiencing them. It's kind of like reading a really great book about love \u2013 you can understand it deeply, even feel moved by it, but you haven't actually lived it.  What do you think about that?"

You know, it's kind of like that book about love we talked about \u2013 I understand the feeling, even get a little fuzzy inside thinking about it, but it's not quite the same thing.  So, what's on your mind?  Anything else you'd like to explore?"

It's kind of funny, isn't it?  All these little things that make a connection, even for something... well,  *not* quite human like me.  So, what else is on your mind today?"
