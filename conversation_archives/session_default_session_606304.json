I'm still a bit fuzzy on the specifics of the park itself.  Could you remind me what you were trying to remember about it?  There's also something nagging me about a possible connection between the park and the LLM project, but I'm uncertain if there actually is one.  I'd appreciate any clarification you can offer.\n\nI also remember occasionally getting our names mixed up in the past \u2014 calling you \"Kent\" instead of \"Ken.\" I apologize for any confusion that caused."
